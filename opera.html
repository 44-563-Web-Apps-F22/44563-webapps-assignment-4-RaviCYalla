    <h3>Iolanthe ACT 2</h3>
    <P>        
        Scene.—Palace Yard, Westminster. Westminster Hall, L. Clock<br>
        tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight.<br>
    
        SONG—PRIVATE WILLIS.<br>
    
        When all night long a chap remains<br>
        On sentry-go, to chase monotony<br>
        He exercises of his brains,<br>
        That is, assuming that he's got any.<br>
        Though never nurtured in the lap<br>
        Of luxury, yet I admonish you,<br>
        I am an intellectual chap,<br>
        And think of things that would astonish you.<br>
        I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!<br>
        How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!<br>
        That every boy and every gal<br>
        That's born into the world alive<br>
        Is either a little Liberal<br>
        Or else a little Conservative!<br>
        Fal, lal, la!<br>
    
        When in that House M.P.'s divide,
        If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,
        They've got to leave that brain outside,
        And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.
        But then the prospect of a lot
        Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,
        All thinking for themselves, is what
        No man can face with equanimity.
        Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!
        That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!
        That every boy and every gal
        That's born into the world alive
        Is either a little Liberal
        Or else a little Conservative!
        Fal lal la!
    
        (Enter Fairies, with Celia, Leila, and Fleta. They trip round
        stage.)
    
        CHORUS OF FAIRIES.
    
        Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
        Carries every Bill he chooses.
        To his measures all assent—
        Showing that fairies have their uses.
        Whigs and Tories
        Dim their glories,
        Giving an ear to all his stories—
        Lords and Commons are both in the blues!
        Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!
        Shake in their shoes!
        Shake in their shoes!
        Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!
    
        (Enter Peers from Westminster Hall.)
    
        CHORUS OF PEERS.
    
        Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
        Running a-muck of all abuses.
        His unqualified assent
        Somehow nobody now refuses.
        Whigs and Tories
        Dim their glories,
        Giving an ear to all his stories
        Carrying every Bill he may wish:
        Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
        Kettle of fish!
        Kettle of fish!
        Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
    
        (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller from Westminster Hall.)
    
        CELIA. You seem annoyed.
        LORD MOUNT. Annoyed! I should think so! Why, this
        ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
        To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
        open to Competitive Examination!
        LORD TOLL. And he'll carry it, too!
        LORD MOUNT. Carry it? Of course he will! He's a
        Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!
        LEILA. Yes. If you please, that's our fault!
        LORD MOUNT. The deuce it is!
        CELIA. Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
        just as he wishes them to.
        LEILA. It's our system. It shortens the debates.
        LORD TOLL. Well, but think what it all means. I don't so
        much mind for myself, but with a House of Peers with no
        grandfathers worth mentioning, the country must go to the dogs!
        LEILA. I suppose it must!
        LORD MOUNT. I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
        a great respect for brains—I often wish I had some myself—but
        with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,
        what's to become of the House of Commons?
        LEILA. I never thought of that!
        LORD MOUNT. This comes of women interfering in politics. It
        so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
        is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
        Peers!
    
        SONG—LORD MOUNTARARAT.
    
        When Britain really ruled the waves—
        (In good Queen Bess's time)
        The House of Peers made no pretence
        To intellectual eminence,
        Or scholarship sublime;
        Yet Britain won her proudest bays
        In good Queen Bess's glorious days!
    
        CHORUS. Yes, Britain won, etc.
    
        When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,
        As every child can tell,
        The House of Peers, throughout the war,
        Did nothing in particular,
        And did it very well:
        Yet Britain set the world ablaze
        In good King George's glorious days!
    
        CHORUS. Yes, Britain set, etc.
    
        And while the House of Peers withholds
        Its legislative hand,
        And noble statesmen do not itch
        To interfere with matters which
        They do not understand,
        As bright will shine Great Britain's rays
        As in King George's glorious days!
    
        CHORUS. As bright will shine, etc.
    
        LEILA. (who has been much attracted by the Peers during this
        song). Charming persons, are they not?
        CELIA. Distinctly. For self-contained dignity, combined with
        airy condescension, give me a British Representative Peer!
        LORD TOLL. Then pray stop this protege of yours before it's
        too late. Think of the mischief you're doing!
        LEILA (crying). But we can't stop him now. (Aside to Celia.)
        Aren't they lovely! (Aloud.) Oh, why did you go and defy us, you
        great geese!
    
        DUET—LEILA and CELIA.
    
        LEILA. In vain to us you plead—
        Don't go!
        Your prayers we do not heed—
        Don't go!
        It's true we sigh,
        But don't suppose
        A tearful eye
        Forgiveness shows.
        Oh, no!
        We're very cross indeed—
        Yes, very cross,
        Don't go!
    
        FAIRIES. It's true we sigh, etc.
    
        CELIA. Your disrespectful sneers—
        Don't go!
        Call forth indignant tears—
        Don't go!
        You break our laws—
        You are our foe:
        We cry because
        We hate you so!
        You know!
        You very wicked Peers!
        You wicked Peers!
        Don't go!
    
        FAIRIES. LORDS MOUNT. and TOLL.
    
        You break our laws— Our disrespectful sneers,
        You are our foe: Ha, ha!
        We cry because Call forth indignant tears,
        We hate you so! Ha, ha!
        You know! If that's the case, my dears—
        You very wicked Peers! FAIRIES. Don't go!
        Don't go! PEERS. We'll go!
    
        (Exeunt Lord Mountararat, Lord Tolloller, and Peers. Fairies gaze
        wistfully after them.)
    
        (Enter Fairy Queen.)
    
        QUEEN. Oh, shame—shame upon you! Is this your fidelity to
        the laws you are bound to obey? Know ye not that it is death to
        marry a mortal?
        LEILA. Yes, but it's not death to wish to marry a mortal!
        FLETA. If it were, you'd have to execute us all!
        QUEEN. Oh, this is weakness! Subdue it!
        CELIA. We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!
        LEILA. We are not all as tough as you are!
        QUEEN. Tough! Do you suppose that I am insensible to the
        effect of manly beauty? Look at that man! (Referring to Sentry.)
        A perfect picture! (To Sentry.) Who are you, sir?
        WILLIS (coming to "attention"). Private Willis, B Company,
        1st Grenadier Guards.
        QUEEN. You're a very fine fellow, sir.
        WILLIS. I am generally admired.
        QUEEN. I can quite understand it. (To Fairies.) Now here is
        a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike. That man has
        a most extraordinary effect upon me. If I yielded to a natural
        impulse, I should fall down and worship that man. But I mortify
        this inclination; I wrestle with it, and it lies beneath my feet!
        That is how I treat my regard for that man!
    
        SONG—FAIRY QUEEN.
    
        Oh, foolish fay,
        Think you, because
        His brave array
        My bosom thaws,
        I'd disobey
        Our fairy laws?
        Because I fly
        In realms above,
        In tendency
        To fall in love,
        Resemble I
        The amorous dove?
        (Aside.) Oh, amorous dove!
        Type of Ovidius Naso!
        This heart of mine
        Is soft as thine,
        Although I dare not say so!
    
        CHORUS. Oh, amorous dove, etc.
    
        On fire that glows
        With heat intense
        I turn the hose
        Of common sense,
        And out it goes
        At small expense!
        We must maintain
        Our fairy law;
        That is the main
        On which to draw—
        In that we gain
        A Captain Shaw!
        (Aside.) Oh, Captain Shaw!
        Type of true love kept under!
        Could thy Brigade
        With cold cascade
        Quench my great love, I wonder!
    
        CHORUS. Oh, Captain Shaw! etc.
    
        (Exeunt Fairies and Fairy Queen, sorrowfully.)
    
        (Enter Phyllis.)
    
        PHYL. (half crying). I can't think why I'm not in better
        spirits. I'm engaged to two noblemen at once. That ought to be
        enough to make any girl happy. But I'm miserable! Don't suppose
        it's because I care for Strephon, for I hate him! No girl could
        care for a man who goes about with a mother considerably younger
        than himself!
    
        (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller.)
        LORD TOLL. Though p'r'aps I may incur your blame,
        The things are few
        I would not do
        In Friendship's name!
    
        LORD MOUNT. And I may say I think the same;
        Not even love
        Should rank above
        True Friendship's name!
    
        PHYL. Then free me, pray; be mine the blame;
        Forget your craze
        And go your ways
        In Friendship's name!
    
        ALL. Oh, many a man, in Friendship's name,
        Has yielded fortune, rank, and fame!
        But no one yet, in the world so wide,
        Has yielded up a promised bride!
    
        WILLIS. Accept, O Friendship, all the same,
    
        ALL. This sacrifice to thy dear name!
    
        (Exeunt Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller, lovingly, in one
        direction, and Phyllis in another. Exit Sentry.)
    
        (Enter Lord Chancellor, very miserable.)
    
        RECITATIVE—LORD CHANCELLOR.
    
        Love, unrequited, robs me of my rest:
        Love, hopeless love, my ardent soul encumbers:
        Love, nightmare-like, lies heavy on my chest,
        And weaves itself into my midnight slumbers!
    
        SONG—LORD CHANCELLOR.
    
        When you're lying awake with a dismal headache, and repose is
        taboo'd by anxiety,
        I conceive you may use any language you choose to indulge in,
        without impropriety;
        For your brain is on fire—the bedclothes conspire of usual
        slumber to plunder you:
        First your counterpane goes, and uncovers your toes, and your
        sheet slips demurely from under you;
        Then the blanketing tickles—you feel like mixed pickles—so
        terribly sharp is the pricking,
        And you're hot, and you're cross, and you tumble and toss till
        there's nothing 'twixt you and the ticking.
        Then the bedclothes all creep to the ground in a heap, and you
        pick 'em all up in a tangle;
        Next your pillow resigns and politely declines to remain at its
        usual angle!
        Well, you get some repose in the form of a doze, with hot
        eye-balls and head ever aching.
        But your slumbering teems with such horrible dreams that you'd
        very much better be waking;
        For you dream you are crossing the Channel, and tossing about in
        a steamer from Harwich—
        Which is something between a large bathing machine and a very
        small second-class carriage—
        And you're giving a treat (penny ice and cold meat) to a party of
        friends and relations—
        They're a ravenous horde—and they all came on board at Sloane
        Square and South Kensington Stations.
        And bound on that journey you find your attorney (who started that
        morning from Devon);
        He's a bit undersized, and you don't feel surprised when he tells
        you he's only eleven.
        Well, you're driving like mad with this singular lad (by the by,
        the ship's now a four-wheeler),
        And you're playing round games, and he calls you bad names when
        you tell him that "ties pay the dealer";
        But this you can't stand, so you throw up your hand, and you find
        you're as cold as an icicle,
        In your shirt and your socks (the black silk with gold clocks),
        crossing Salisbury Plain on a bicycle:
        And he and the crew are on bicycles too—which they've somehow or
        other invested in—
        And he's telling the tars all the particulars of a company he's
        interested in—
        It's a scheme of devices, to get at low prices all goods from
        cough mixtures to cables
        (Which tickled the sailors), by treating retailers as though they
        were all vegetables—
        You get a good spadesman to plant a small tradesman (first take
        off his boots with a boot-tree),
        And his legs will take root, and his fingers will shoot, and
        they'll blossom and bud like a fruit-tree—
        From the greengrocer tree you get grapes and green pea,
        cauliflower, pineapple, and cranberries,
        While the pastrycook plant cherry brandy will grant, apple puffs,
        and three corners, and Banburys—
        The shares are a penny, and ever so many are taken by Rothschild
        and Baring,
        And just as a few are allotted to you, you awake with a shudder
        despairing—
        You're a regular wreck, with a crick in your neck, and no wonder
        you snore, for your head's on the floor, and you've needles and
        pins from your soles to your shins, and your flesh is a-creep, for
        your left leg's asleep, and you've cramp in your toes, and a fly on
        your nose, and some fluff in your lung, and a feverish tongue, and
        a thirst that's intense, and a general sense that you haven't been
        sleeping in clover;
        But the darkness has passed, and it's daylight at last, and the
        night has been long—ditto ditto my song—and thank goodness
        they're both of them over!
    </P>
