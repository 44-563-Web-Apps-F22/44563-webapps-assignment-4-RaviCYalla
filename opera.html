    <h3>Iolanthe ACT 2</h3>
    <h3 style="color:brown">Act 2: Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h3>
    <P>        
        <h4 class ="scene">Scene.</h4><p class = "scene">-Palace Yard, Westminster. Westminster Hall, L. Clock
        tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight.</p>
    
        <h4 class ="SONG—PRIVATE">SONG—PRIVATE WILLIS.</h4><p class = "song">
    
        When all night long a chap remains
        On sentry-go, to chase monotony
        He exercises of his brains,
        That is, assuming that he's got any.
        Though never nurtured in the lap
        Of luxury, yet I admonish you,
        I am an intellectual chap,
        And think of things that would astonish you.
        I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!
        How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!
        That every boy and every gal
        That's born into the world alive
        Is either a little Liberal
        Or else a little Conservative!
        Fal, lal, la!
    
        When in that House M.P.'s divide,
        If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,
        They've got to leave that brain outside,
        And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.
        But then the prospect of a lot
        Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,
        All thinking for themselves, is what
        No man can face with equanimity. 
        Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!
        That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!
        That every boy and every gal
        That's born into the world alive
        Is either a little Liberal
        Or else a little Conservative!
        Fal lal la!</p>

        <h4 class="lordmount">LORD MOUNT.</h4><p class="speech"> Annoyed! I should think so! Why, this
        ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
        To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
        open to Competitive Examination!</p>
        <h4 class ="lordtoll">LORD TOLL.</h4><p class="speech"> And he'll carry it, too!</p>
        <h4 class ="lordmount">LORD MOUNT.</h4><p class=""speech">Carry it? Of course he will! He's a
        Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!</p>

        <h4 class ="celia">CELIA.</h4><p class = "speech"> Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
        just as he wishes them to.</p>
        <h4 class = "leila">LEILA.</h4><p class = "speech"><p class = "directions">(which is English for "repente"),</p> It's our system. It shortens the debates.</p>
        <h4 class ="lordtoll">LORD TOLL.</h4><p class = "speech"> Well, but think what it all means. I don't so
        much mind for myself, but with a House of Peers with no
        grandfathers worth mentioning, the country must go to the dogs!</p>
        <h4 class ="leila">LEILA.</h4><p class = "speech"> I suppose it must!</p>
        <h4 class ="lordmount">LORD MOUNT.</h4><p class = "speech"> I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
        a great respect for brains—I often wish I had some myself—but
        with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,
        what's to become of the House of Commons?</p>
        <h4 class ="leila">LEILA.</h4><p class = "speech"> I never thought of that!</p>
        <h4 class ="lordmount">LORD MOUNT.</h4><p class ="speech"> This comes of women interfering in politics. It
        so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
        is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
        Peers!</p>
